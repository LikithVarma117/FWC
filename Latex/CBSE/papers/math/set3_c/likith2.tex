\item
A man standing on the deck of a ship, which is 10 m above water level,
observes the angle of elevation of the top of a hill as $60^\circ$
and the angle of depression of the base of the hill as $30^\circ$.
Find the distance of the hill from the ship and the height of the hill.

\item
Three different coins are tossed together.
Find the probability of getting
\begin{enumerate}
\item exactly two heads
\item at least two heads
\item at least two tails
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Question numbers 21 to 31 carry 4 marks each.}

\item
Due to heavy floods in a state, thousands were rendered homeless.
Fifty schools collectively offered to the state government to provide
place and canvas for 1500 tents.
The lower part of each tent is cylindrical of base radius 2.8 m and
height 3.5 m with a conical upper part of the same base radius and
height 2.1 m.
If the canvas used to make the tents costs Rs.\ 120 per sq.m,
find the amount shared by each school.
Use $\pi=\frac{22}{7}$.

\item
Prove that the lengths of tangents drawn from an external point
to a circle are equal.

\item
Draw a circle of radius 4 cm.
Draw two tangents to the circle inclined at an angle of $60^\circ$
to each other.

\item
In the figure, two equal circles with centres $O$ and $O'$ touch each other at $X$.
$OO'$ produced meets the circle with centre $O'$ at $A$.
$AC$ is tangent to the circle with centre $O$ at the point $C$.
$O'D$ is perpendicular to $AC$.
Find the value of $\dfrac{DO'}{CO}$.

\item
Solve for $x$:
\newline
$\frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{2}{x+2} = \frac{4}{x+4},
\quad x \neq -1,-2,-4$


\item
The angle of elevation of the top $Q$ of a vertical tower $PQ$
from a point $X$ on the ground is $60^\circ$.
From a point $Y$, 40 m vertically above $X$,
the angle of elevation of the top $Q$ of the tower is $45^\circ$.
Find the height of the tower $PQ$ and the distance $PX$.
Use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$.

\item
The houses in a row are numbered consecutively from 1 to 49.
Show that there exists a value of $X$ such that the sum of the numbers
of houses preceding the house numbered $X$
is equal to the sum of the numbers of houses following $X$.

\item
In the figure, the vertices of $\triangle ABC$ are
$A(4,6)$, $B(1,5)$ and $C(7,2)$.
A line segment $DE$ is drawn to intersect the sides $AB$ and $AC$
at $D$ and $E$ respectively such that:

{\Large
\hspace{1.8 cm}
$\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{1}{3}$
}

Calculate the area of $\triangle ADE$ and compare it with the area
of $\triangle ABC$.

\item
A number $x$ is selected at random from the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Another number $y$ is selected at random from the numbers
1, 4, 9 and 16.
Find the probability that the product of $x$ and $y$ is less than 16.

\item
In the figure, a sector $OAP$ of a circle with centre $O$
containing angle $\theta$ is shown.
$AB$ is perpendicular to the radius $OA$ and meets $OP$ produced at $B$.
Prove that the perimeter of the shaded region is:
\newline
{\Large
\hspace{0.1 cm}
$r\left(\tan\theta + \sec\theta + \frac{\pi\theta}{180} - 1\right)$

\item
A motor boat whose speed is 24 km/h in still water
takes 1 hour more to go 32 km upstream
than to return downstream to the same spot.
Find the speed of the stream.
