\textbf{21.} Due to heavy floods in a state, 50 schools collectively offered to the state canvas for 1500 tents to be fixed by the government expenditure equally.

The lower part of each tent is cylindrical with conical upper part of same base radius.  
If the canvas costs Rs 120 per sq.m, find the amount shared by each school to set up the tents.  
(Use $\pi=\frac{22}{7}$)

\textbf{26.} The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from the ground is $60^\circ$.  
From a point $Y$, $40$ m vertically above the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $45^\circ$.  
Find the height of the tower $PQ$ and the distance of the foot of the tower from the point of observation.  
(Use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$)

\textbf{28.} In Fig., the vertices of $\triangle ABC$ are shown.  
A line-segment $DE$ is drawn to intersect the sides respectively such that
\[
\frac{AD}{AB}=\frac{AE}{AC}=\frac{1}{3}.
\]
Calculate the area of $\triangle ADE$ and compare it with the area of $\triangle ABC$.
